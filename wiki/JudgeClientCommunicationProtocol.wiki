= Introduction =

This page defines the communication protocol between the judge client and the judge queue service.

= Definition =

 * "the service" is the judge queue service.
 * "the client" is the judge client.
 * "the program" is the one to be judged.
 * "the source file" is the program's source file

All messages between the service and the client are in binary format. Integers are always sent in network order (Big Endian).

= Details =
A typical judge request contains 5 parts:
== 1. Header ==
The service first sends out a header to the client. A header is always 9 bytes long and contains the following fields:
|| *Name* || *Size* || *Description* ||
|| Source File Type || 1 || The source file type code which is defined [SourceFileSuffixList here]. The client uses it to determine which compiler to use. ||
|| Problem Id || 4 || An unsigned integer which is the global unique id of the problem that the source file tries to solve. ||
|| Version || 4 || An unsigned integer representing the current version of the problem. If this version is not found by the judge client, a synchronization is required. ||

== 2. Source File ==
The service should send the source file to the client immediately after the header. The file should be compressed using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77) before transmission, that is, the gzip file format. The service first sends a 2-byte unsigned integer indicating the size of the compressed file in bytes, then its content. Neither the original nor the compressed source file size can be more than 65536(64K).

Especially, if the client runs on the same machine with the service, then the service should send the path of the source file instead of its content to the client. The service sends a 2-byte unsigned integer indicating the length of the path followed by the path itself.

== 3. Client Response ==
After the client receives the header and the source file(if required), it will reply with a one-byte code defined as follows:
|| *Code* || *Name* || *Description* ||
|| 100 || Ready || Everything is ok. The client is ready to judge the program. ||
|| 101 || Unsupported Source File Type || The client does not know how to compile the source file. It can happen when the service sends out an invalid one or to a wrong client. ||
|| 102 || No Such Problem || The problem or its specified version is not found by the client. Need data synchronization. ||
|| 103 || Invalid Data Size || Source file size is 0 or too large. ||
|| 104 || Invalid Data || Source file can not be decompressed or its size is too large. ||
|| 14 || Internal Error || Something wrong in the client itself. Could be caused by system issues, for example, the disk is full. ||

== 4. Data Synchronization ==
If the client replies with code 102(No Such Problem), the service should send the problem data to the client.

The data should be a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKZIP PKZIP] compatible zip file. Its content should have exactly the same structure as the directory for a specific version of a problem, which is defined [ProblemDirectoryStructure here]

The service first sends a 4-byte unsigned integer indicating the size of the zip file in bytes, then its binary content.

After the client receives the data file, it will reply with one of the following code:
|| *Code* || *Name* || *Description* ||
|| 100 || Ready || Everything is ok. The client is ready to judge the program. ||
|| 103 || !InvalidDataSize || Data file size is not a positive integer. ||
|| 104 || !InvalidData || Data file can not be decompressed or its content structure is invalid. ||
|| 14 || Internal Error || Something wrong in the client itself. Could be caused by system issues, for example, the disk is full. ||

== 5. Judge ==
After everything is ready, the service can ask the client to run testcases. It is a 9-byte long message defined as follows:
|| *Name* || *Size* || *Description* ||
|| Testcase Number || 1 || The number of testcase which should be provided as the input of the source file. 0 means to end the whole judge request. ||
|| Time Limit || 2 || The maximum limit of the running time of the program, in seconds. It should be no more than 300(5 minutes). ||
|| Memory Limit || 4 || The maximum size of the memory that can be used by the program, in kilobytes. It should be no more than 1048576(1G). ||
|| Output Limit || 2 || The maximum size of output that can be generated by the program, in kilobytes. It should be no more than 16384(16M). ||

The client will validate the message and sends back an error code if any field is invalid:
|| *Code* || *Name* || *Description* ||
|| 105 || Invalid Testcase || No corresponding testcase found by the client. ||
|| 106 || Invalid Time Limit || Time limit is 0 or too large. ||
|| 107 || Invalid Memory Limit || Memory limit is 0 or too large. ||
|| 108 || Invalid Output Limit || Output limit is 0 or too large. ||
|| 14 || Internal Error || Something wrong in the client itself. Could be caused by system issues, for example, the disk is full. ||

Otherwise the client begins to judge the program. It will report the judging status to the service continuously.

All possible status codes are defined in the following table:
|| *Code* || *Name* || *Description* ||
|| 1 || Compiling || The client is compiling the source file. ||
|| 2 || Running || The client is executing the program. If it is the case, the following 8 bytes will represent the program's CPU time in milliseconds and its peak memory usage in kilobytes respectively, each occupies 4 bytes. ||
|| 3 || !RuntimeError || The program is terminated abnormally. ||
|| 4 || !WrongAnswer || The program's output is not the same as the standard output. ||
|| 5 || Accepted || The program's output is exactly the same as the standard output. ||
|| 6 || !TimeLimitExceeded || The program's running time exceeds the limit. ||
|| 7 || !MemoryLimitExceeded || The program's memory usage exceeds the limit. ||
|| 10 || !OutputLimitExceeded || The program's output size exceeds the limit. ||
|| 12 || !CompilationError || The compilation of the source file fails. ||
|| 13 || !PresentationError || The program's output is generally the same as the standard output, except for some white spaces or blank lines. ||
|| 14 || !InternalError || Something wrong in the client itself. Could be caused by system issues, for example, the disk is full. ||
|| 15 || !FloatingPointError || Like division by zero ||
|| 16 || !SegmentationFault || The program is terminated due to a segmentation fault. ||
|| 19 || Judging || The client is comparing the output of the program and the standard output. ||
